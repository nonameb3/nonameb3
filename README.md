# Hey, I'm Waraphon! ðŸ‘‹

Senior engineer from Bangkok who loves building things that matter. Currently architecting blockchain systems at TokenX while exploring how AI can make development more delightful.

You'll find me experimenting with LLMs and building tools that make coding more fun.

Check out my [AI chat playground](https://ai-chat.roonnapai.dev) where I test different AI integrations.
